            /*JavaScript Data Types
            JavaScript variables can hold many data types: numbers, strings, objects and more:
            var length = 16;                               // Number
            var lastName = "Johnson";                      // String
            var x = {firstName:"John", lastName:"Doe"};    // Object 
            
            var x = 16 + 4 + "Volvo";
            result: 20Volvo
            In the first example, JavaScript treats 16 and 4 as numbers, until it reaches "Volvo".
            JavaScript has dynamic types. This means that the same variable can be used to hold different data types:
            var x;           // Now x is undefined
            x = 5;           // Now x is a Number
            x = "John";      // Now x is a String
            Strings are written with quotes. You can use single or double quotes:
            JavaScript has only one type of numbers.
            Numbers can be written with, or without decimals:
            Booleans can only have two values: true or false.
            JavaScript arrays are written with square brackets.
            JavaScript objects are written with curly braces {}.
            Object properties are written as name:value pairs, separated by commas.
            Primitive Data
            A primitive data value is a single simple data value with no additional properties and methods.
            The typeof operator can return one of these primitive types:
            string
            number
            boolean
            undefined
            Complex Data
            The typeof operator can return one of two complex types:
            function
            object
            The typeof operator returns "object" for objects, arrays, and null.
            The typeof operator does not return "object" for functions.
